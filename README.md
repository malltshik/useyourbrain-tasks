- Is up to K (from dailycodingproblem.com)

```text
This problem was recently asked by Google.
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

- RepeatableCharacter

a duplicate ones in source string
For instance:

```

- StairsToTheTop

```text
In this task you have a N stairs and set of allowed step's sizes

For instance:
Given N = 2, S = {1,2}
You have to decide how many paths you might to use to going from bottom to top
In that example return value will be 2, because you could finish starts by one step from bottom to top
and by two steps from 0 to 1 stair and next step would be from 1 to 2 stair
```

- HopTowers

```text
In this task you get an array of tower where each element means high of tower
High of tower at the same time means how many steps you allow to do
For instance:
Given [1,2,0,3]
From index 0 at the first tower which high is 1 you allow to do only one step
From index 1 at the second tower which high is 2 you allow to do 2 steps or less (to third or fourth tower)
Therefore you need return true if towers in possible to hopped over the end and false at the other way
```
